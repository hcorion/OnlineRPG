# OnlineRPG
A simple text-based RPG project using HTML, JS, JQuery, CSS, W3.CSS,  XML and JSON.

Please note! When serving this locally it does not work with Chrome and may not work with IE (I haven't tested it yet). Please use firefox.

TODO:
- Read more information from the XML
- Add people to the XML
- Add People To See in each location (supported in XML, but not javascript)
- Add the ability to talk to people
- Add the ability for locations to have additional descriptions.
- Add debugging (for example, if it wants to send you somewhere that doesn't have a location.)
- Add the ability to converse with NPCs
- Implement custom location and NPC variables.
- Hash and Salt passwords (look into this more, it's currently not that important)
- Add the ability to create users from the webpage (implement after figuring out how to hash and salt passwords)

Cool stuff to look into:
