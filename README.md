# OnlineRPG
A simple text-based RPG project using HTML, JS, JQuery, CSS, W3.CSS,  XML and JSON.

Please note! When serving this locally it does not work with Chrome and may not work with IE (I haven't tested it yet). Please use firefox.

TODO:
- Read more information from the XML
- Add People To See in each location (supported in XML, but not javascript)
- Make it so that the Places To Go Link and the People to See Links do stuff.
- Add the ability to talk to people
- Add debugging (for example, if it wants to send you somewhere that doesn't have a location.)

Cool stuff to look into: 
- Google Polymer https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/
